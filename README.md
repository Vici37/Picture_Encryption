Encrypt is a program written in java with the purpose of hiding messages in pictures
using least significant bit encryption. That's basically separating a character into
its binary representation and putting the ones and zeros into their own pixels. Upon 
decryption, the program gathers up all of the ones and zeroes and inteprets them as
ASCII characters.
